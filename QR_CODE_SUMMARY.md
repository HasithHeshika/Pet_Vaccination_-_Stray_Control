# ‚úÖ QR Code System Updated - Summary

## What Was Done

### Problem
When users scanned pet QR codes, they saw raw JSON data which was:
- ‚ùå Hard to read
- ‚ùå Not user-friendly
- ‚ùå Unprofessional looking
- ‚ùå Difficult to find contact information quickly

### Solution
Updated the QR code system to generate a URL that opens a beautiful, professional web page showing all pet details in an easy-to-read format.
